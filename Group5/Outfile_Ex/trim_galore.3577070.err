AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /projects/intro2gds/I2GDS2025/TestData_LinuxPeerEval/G5_testdata/SRR17048878_1.fastq <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	25000	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	25000	0.00
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	25000	0.00
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count Illumina: 0, count smallRNA: 0, count Nextera: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).
